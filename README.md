# Restavo

---

Restavo is a project that I developed in Pia Academy Summer Camp Program. In this program, we were asked to develop one of several projects determined by the participants. This project, chosen by me and my other friends in my group, is a zomato.com clone. This project, chosen by me and my other friends in my group, is a site developed with reference to zomato.com. In this project, my duties were to design the site using Angular, to display the data in the database on the site, and to send add, update, delete requests to the database. We created this project in 4 days. After the program I have lost the access to the database. Because of this, I created a new dataset using mockAPI and now I'm doing all the process in this way.
